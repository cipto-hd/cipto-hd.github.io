I think that git is the de facto VCS for developers whether they're coding for desktop, mobile, or the web.

We can clone a project and it give us a full featured version tracking system which is vital to coders. This guide is intended for beginner users. I hope it will be usefull.

Just execute these commands below in consecutive order. Here the they are:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:git-core/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git
```
