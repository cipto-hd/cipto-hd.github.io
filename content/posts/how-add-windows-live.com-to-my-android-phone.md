Sometimes one account is not enough on android. Gmail is good but some people want alternative such as Windows live. Here I will show you how to add live.com to your android phone.

Below are the steps:

1. Open Settings and scroll down untill you see + Add Account.
2. Click Corporate.
3. Enter your email address and password (<b>attention</b>: if you've enabled 2 steps verification, you must use an app password, check this <a href="http://www.ciptohadi.web.id/2015/03/create-windows-livecom-app-password.html">post</a> for how to generate it) and then click Next.

Just follow the onscreen instructions.

Good luck! :-)
