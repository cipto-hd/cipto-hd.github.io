Windows live.com app password is especially important and required if you want to sign in to an app using your live.com account which does not support 2 steps verification. It is assumed that you have enabled 2 steps verification of your live.com account before. In my case, I use this app password to add an live.com account to my Android phone.

I will tell you how to create that app password step by step. Here they are:

1. Make sure you have logged in to [live.com](live.com).
2. In the inbox view, click the setting button and then Option menu item. Options page will show up.

6. On the page that show up, scroll down until you find App passwords section. Click “Create new app password” menu and you will be presented with a new page containing the new app password.
