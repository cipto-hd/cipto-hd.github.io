You have no success downloading printer driver for epson lx-300 by using windows update?? Don't worry you can download the driver directly from microsoft update catalog site.

For Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 8.1, the url would be http://catalog.update.microsoft.com/v7/site/home.aspx. Open that url via Internet Explorer, not other browsers. Then you just need to search the driver and then add it to update basket. Finally open the update basket and download the driver. Done.

I have already downloaded the driver and now share it via this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0BwwMwCuweRO_azhzNFV0WURaX00/view?usp=sharing). Feel free to download it.
