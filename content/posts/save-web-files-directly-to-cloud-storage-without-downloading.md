It was annoying to download web files just for uploading them to cloud without a need to have them offline, just to mirror the files on our cloud.

Now you don't have to worry about it. There is already a web service that enable you to save web files directly to your own cloud storage. It is http://ctrlq.org/save/. You only need to supply the url of file to be saved to a cloud storage and click the "save to" button corresponding to the cloud storage of your choice. Then you will be prompted to give appropriate authorization to the web app so that it can save the file for you.

This kind of service woud be very helpful if we have to download a big file that cannot be resumed. Then we can save it to a cloud storage that support resuming for later download. According to my experience, only skydrive from microsoft that box.com suppot resuming.

Any invalid information here? Please let me now at the comment box.
